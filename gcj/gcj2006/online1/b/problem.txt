Problem Statement
ÿÿÿÿ
Given a positive integer k, the binary representation expresses k as a sum of powers of 2. Each digit in the binary representation is allowed to be 0 or 1 (for example, 9 = 10012 = 23 + 20). What if it could be 0, 1 or 2? Given k you will return how many different binary decompositions it has, where the digit values can be 0, 1 or 2. Note, each representation has no leading zeros.
