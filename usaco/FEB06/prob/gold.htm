                           GOLD PROBLEMS
**********************************************************************
                  Four problems numbered 1 through 4
**********************************************************************

Problem 1: Treats for the Cows [Marco Gallotta, 2005]

FJ has purchased N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 2000) yummy treats for the cows who
get money for giving vast amounts of milk. FJ sells one treat per
day and wants to maximize the money he receives over a given period
time.

The treats are interesting for many reasons:
  * The treats are numbered 1..N and stored sequentially in single
    file in a long box that is open at both ends. On any day, FJ
    can retrieve one treat from either end of his stash of treats.
  * Like fine wines and delicious cheeses, the treats improve with
    age and command greater prices.
  * The treats are not uniform: some are better and have higher
    intrinsic value. Treat i has value v(i) (1 &lt;= v(i) &lt;= 1000).
  * Cows pay more for treats that have aged longer: a cow will
    pay v(i)*a for a treat of age a.

Given the values v(i) of each of the treats lined up in order of
the index i in their box, what is the greatest value FJ can receive
for them if he orders their sale optimally?

The first treat is sold on day 1 and has age a=1. Each subsequent
day increases the age by 1.

PROBLEM NAME: trt

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer, N

* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains the value of treat v(i)

SAMPLE INPUT (file trt.in):

5
1
3
1
5
2

INPUT DETAILS:

Five treats. On the first day FJ can sell either treat #1 (value 1) or
treat #5 (value 2).

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The maximum revenue FJ can achieve by selling the treats

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file trt.out):

43

OUTPUT DETAILS:

FJ sells the treats (values 1, 3, 1, 5, 2) in the following order
of indices: 1, 5, 2, 3, 4, making 1x1 + 2x2 + 3x3 + 4x1 + 5x5 = 43.

**********************************************************************

Problem 2: Backward Digit Sums [Harry Wiggins, 2002]

FJ and his cows enjoy playing a mental game. They write down the
numbers from 1 to N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10) in a certain order and then sum
adjacent numbers to produce a new list with one fewer number.  They
repeat this until only a single number is left.  For example, one
instance of the game (when N=4) might go like this:

    3   1   2   4
      4   3   6
        7   9
         16

Behind FJ's back, the cows have started playing a more difficult
game, in which they try to determine the starting sequence from
only the final total and the number N.  Unfortunately, the game is
a bit above FJ's mental arithmetic capabilities.

Write a program to help FJ play the game and keep up with the cows.

PROBLEM NAME: bdsum

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and the final sum.

SAMPLE INPUT (file bdsum.in):

4 16

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: An ordering of the integers 1..N that leads to the given
        sum.  If there are multiple solutions, choose the one that is
        lexicographically least, i.e., that puts smaller numbers
        first.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file bdsum.out):

3 1 2 4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

There are other possible sequences, such as 3 2 1 4, but 3 1 2 4
is the lexicographically smallest.

Problem 3: Cellphones [Bruce Merry, 2003]

The cows have started using cellphones to cowmunicate with each
other, but have found that the button layout doesn't suit their
hooves very well. They are designing a special cellphone will fewer
but larger buttons.

One feature they liked on the standard cellphones was predictive
text. Each button has a few letters associated with it, and one
types a word by pushing the associated buttons. Because there is
more than one letter for each button, this can be ambiguous for
some words.  However, most of the time the ambiguity can be resolved
by using a dictionary to determine what word the user wanted.

Since the cows are designing a custom cellphone, they are also going
to replace the English alphabet with the Cow alphabet. By an amazing
coincidence, the cow alphabet is simply the first L (1 &lt;= L &lt;= 26)
letters of the English alphabet, in the same order. They want to
find out how to assign the letters of the Cow alphabet to the B
buttons (1 &lt;= B &lt;= L) in such a way that the maximum number of words
in their dictionary are unambiguous when entered with predictive
text. Like normal cellphones, they want the letters on each button
to be a contiguous section (one or more consecutive letters) of the
alphabet.

This is a '#FILE' problem -- you calculate the answers on your own
computer and submit them one output file per submission.  Precede
each output file with a #FILE header like this:

#FILE cell 3

where '3' is the case number of the solution you're submitting.  Of
course, you'll substitute other numbers for 3!

The input data is found at http://ace.delos.com/cell.zip 

PROBLEM NAME: cell

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer, N, indicating the number of the current
        test case. This is the number which must appear in the #FILE
        header at the top of your output.

* Line 2: Two space-separated integers: B and L

* Line 3: D, the number of words in the dictionary (1 &lt;= D &lt;= 1000)

* Lines 4..D+3: Each line contains one word from the dictionary in
        upper case and of length 1..10 characters. The words are
        presented in alphabetical order and with no duplicates.

SAMPLE INPUT (file cell.in):

1
3 13
11
ALL
BALL
BELL
CALK
CALL
CELL
DILL
FILL
FILM
ILL
MILK

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The header, as described above

* Line 2: The number of words in the Cow dictionary that have unique
        button sequences.

* Lines 3..B+2: The nth line contains the letters that appear on
        button n, in upper case and alphabetical order. The lines must
        be listed in alphabetical order, and every Cow letter must
        appear exactly once. If there is more than one optimal
        solution, use the one that places the most letters on button
        1. Ties are broken by placing the most letters on button 2,
        etc.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file cell.out):

#FILE cell 1
7
AB
CDEFGHIJK
LM

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Button 1 contains AB, button two contains C-K, and button 3 contains
LM. The words CELL, DILL, FILL and FILM are all entered as 2233,
while the remaining 7 words are all entered uniquely.

Problem 4: Steady Cow Assignment [Coaches, 2004]

Farmer John's N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1000) cows each reside in one of B (1
&lt;= B &lt;= 20) barns which, of course, have limited capacity. Some
cows really like their current barn, and some are not so happy.

FJ would like to rearrange the cows such that the cows are as equally
happy as possible, even if that means all the cows hate their
assigned barn.

Each cow gives FJ the order in which she prefers the barns.  A cow's
happiness with a particular assignment is her ranking of her barn.
Your job is to find an assignment of cows to barns such that no
barn's capacity is exceeded and the size of the range (i.e., one
more than the positive difference between the the highest-ranked
barn chosen and that lowest-ranked barn chosen) of barn rankings
the cows give their assigned barns is as small as possible.

Time limit: 2 seconds for each test case

PROBLEM NAME: stead

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two space-separated integers, N and B

* Lines 2..N+1: Each line contains B space-separated integers which
        are exactly 1..B sorted into some order. The first integer on
        line i+1 is the number of the cow i's top-choice barn, the
        second integer on that line is the number of the i'th cow's
        second-choice barn, and so on.

* Line N+2: B space-separated integers, respectively the capacity of
        the first barn, then the capacity of the second, and so on. 
        The sum of these numbers is guaranteed to be at least N.

SAMPLE INPUT (file stead.in):

6 4
1 2 3 4
2 3 1 4
4 2 3 1
3 1 2 4
1 3 4 2
1 4 2 3
2 1 3 2

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: One integer, the size of the minumum range of barn rankings
        the cows give their assigned barns, including the endpoints.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file stead.out):

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Each cow can be assigned to her first or second choice: barn 1 gets
cows 1 and 5, barn 2 gets cow 2, barn 3 gets cow 4, and barn 4 gets
cows 3 and 6.
