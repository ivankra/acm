                     NOVEMBER 2005 CONTEST RESULTS

These are the final results of the USACO NOVEMBER 2005 programming
contest.  The next contest is the USACO DECEMBER 2006 contest to
be held 9-12 December, 2005.

Our goal in these contests is to cultivate interest in computer
programming among pre-college students and recognize those who are
outstanding performers.

This contest had 607 competitors and 204 observers, a total of 811
legal entrants:

An additional 97 contestants (61 apparently from China) were
disqualified for not following the rules; all have been banned for
life.

The 811 contestants and observers hailed from these 66 countries:

The grading system accepted 1.46 GB of text (mostly programs but
the occasional binary), a total of 8,406 submissions.  Here's a
summary of how the final graded submissions looked (including
observers):

         Program  Subs    C      Pascal    Java
GOLD
        ontherun  175  119/68%   45/26%   11/ 6%

         numgrid  309  133/43%  150/49%   26/ 8%

Java submissions are now slowly growing at all levels, though still
in single digit percentages.

Mechanically, the contest had but one bug (a network failure just
after it opened). Logistically, the contest ran perfectly, very few
questions.

As to the distributions of results:
   * Bronze had a large number of perfect scores; many will be
     moving up to Silver
   * Silver had an almost perfectly shaped bell curve with a few
     very-high scores; they will be moving to Gold
   * Gold scores were spread out across the spectrum with 17
     perfect scores -- we'll try to make it a bit more challenging
     next time.

The new JAVA compiler worked out well, though it has a high execution
startup time that some commented upon.  We're working on a new
scaling mechanism (currently JAVA times are divided by 1.5 before
being reported).

Test data is available at http://ace.delos.com/NOV05.htm .  Special
thanks to South Africa's Bruce Merry for his great effort on analyses.

### GOLD Division ######################################################

The GOLD contest worked out well. The ultimate task difficulties
were similar, with 'twalk' being a bit harder than the other two.

         points weight  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b
     --------------------------------------------------
   asteroid:  91 311.5  0  8  9  7  8  7  8 10  7 14 13
   ontherun:  89 298.7  0  7  7  8  8  9  8 14 13 15
      twalk:  90 389.8  0  7  8  8 10 13 15 14 15

Unlike the end of last year, seniors dominated this division's
entries. I've written a letter to the alleged 11 year old to verify
his age.

  Distribution by grade:
    Grde  #  Percent
    2006  81 (54.4%) *****************************************
    2007  48 (32.2%) ************************
    2008  15 (10.1%) *******
    2009   3 ( 2.0%) *
    2010   1 ( 0.7%)
    2013   1 ( 0.7%)

The score distribution was, as always, interesting. This time it's
very spread out with modes (peaks) near 1000, 725, 4250, and 275
(and 175):

===== Distribution of scores =====
951..1000 17  *****************
901.. 950  6  ******
851.. 900  5  *****
801.. 850  6  ******
751.. 800  4  ****
701.. 750  9  *********
651.. 700  7  *******
601.. 650  5  *****
551.. 600  6  ******
501.. 550  7  *******
451.. 500  8  ********
401.. 450 12  ************
351.. 400  5  *****
301.. 350  8  ********
251.. 300 19  *******************
201.. 250  6  ******
151.. 200 10  **********
101.. 150  5  *****
 51.. 100  3  ***
  1..  50  0
  0..   0  1  *

Of course, this distribution is very much affected by the scoring
algorithm used which pushes scores much toward the lower end in an
effort to spread out the top competitors.

Don't forget: We love difficult (but legal) test data sent in by
competitors.  We almost always trim out the test data so that test
cases really do reflect some new dimension of the solution.  We do
this by removing those test cases with high correlations with other
test cases.

Here are the top competitors from the GOLD division, all with
perfect scores.

     2007 BGR Rostislav Rumenov          2007 CHN Zhou Hang
     2007 BLR Vladimir Minjailov         2006 CHN Zhu Chenguang
     2006 CAN Richard Peng               2007 IRN Nima Ahmadi Pour
     2008 CHN Berry Knight               2006 POL Filip Wolski
     2006 CHN Chen Xue                   2006 ROM Catalin Tiseanu
     2007 CHN Cheng Yu                   2006 ROM Tiberiu Florea
     2006 CHN Maigo Akisame              2006 ROM Vladu Adrian
     2008 CHN Yang Yi                    2007 USA Richard McCutchen
     2006 CHN Zeyuan Zhu

China absolutely dominated this group with almost half of the perfect
scores (8). Poland's Filip Wolski continues his winning streak after
last year's world championship. Five of these competitors attended
last June's USA Invitational Computing Olympiad.

Romania had three winners; one each from Bulgaria, Belarus, Canada,
Iran, Poland, and USA.

Congratulations to these outstanding competitors.

## SILVER Division #####################################################

The SILVER division's problems yielded a nice contest this time,
though USA senior Jacob Steinhardt's 'ants' DP problem was very
challenging. Topcoder champ Mathijs Vogelzang's 'skyline' problem
garnered a large set of compliments on its originality.

         points weight  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a

    skyline:  49 222.0  0  7  7  7  7 10 11
    acrobat:  94 378.0  0  7  7  9 15 10 12 15  9 10
       ants:  95 400.0  0  4  9  9 10 10 11 14 13 15

The SILVER Division had five competitors with a perfect score of
1000 points and three more above 800:

          2008 BLR Nick Kostyukovich   1000
          2007 CHN Wenhao Huang        1000
          2007 GRC Christos Mantoulidi 1000
          2007 IRN Hassan Eslami       1000
          2006 MEX Luis Enrique Vargas 1000
          2007 CHN Mian Yang            895
          2008 CHN Huacheng Yu          891
          2007 HRV Domagoj Kusalic      827

Congratulations to those who achieve perfection! It's very difficult
to do.

China had three competitors in this group; Belarus, Greece, Iran,
Mexico, and Croatia had one each.

Note that some contestants with very high scores were promoted to
the GOLD division while the contest was underway. They are not shown
here.

All eight competitors above have been promoted to the GOLD competition.

Upperclassmen compose over two thirds of the competitors, with
Juniors as the plurality:

  Distribution by grade:
    Grde  #  Percent
    2006  46 (30.9%) ***********************
    2007  58 (38.9%) *****************************
    2008  30 (20.1%) ***************
    2009   9 ( 6.0%) ****
    2010   3 ( 2.0%) *
    2011   2 ( 1.3%) *
    2012   1 ( 0.7%)

The contest's distribution was spread out over a large range, with
a strong resemblance to a bell curve (plus the tail at the top, of
course):

===== Distribution of scores =====
951..1000  5  *****
901.. 950  0
851.. 900  2  **

## BRONZE Division #####################################################

The BRONZE division had problems that 48 competitors were able to
conquer completely. This is not unusual as we move sort students
into their proper division at the beginning of the season.

82 competitors (those who solved certain problems well) have been moved
up to the SILVER division.

Here is the list of the 1000 point scorers:

2007 BGR Ivan Ivanov	      2007 CHN shui han		    2009 POL Wiktor Jakubiuk

2006 CHN chenshen wu	      2006 POL Krzysztof Krygiel    2006 ZAF Joshua Yudaken

China again had the largest number of perfectionists, with USA not too far
behind:
  11 CHN     2 TUR     1 ZAF     1 MAC     1 EGY
   7 USA     2 POL     1 TWN     1 HUN     1 CAN
   3 BLR     2 IRN     1 RUS     1 GRC
   3 BGR     2 HRV     1 ROM     1 GEO
   2 VNM     2 DEU     1 NED     1 FRA

The recursive 'passwd' task worked out to be the simplest; the
'numgrid' problem almost maxed out the difficulty points:

         points weight  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a
     -----------------------------------------------
     passwd:  89 272.5  0 10  9 10 10 10 10 10 10 10
    numgrid:  76 393.0  0  8  8  9 11  9 11 11  9
     satpix:  97 334.4  0  8  8  8  9  8 12 14 15 15

The distribution of scores showed a multi-modal (several peaks)
distribution, which makes sense since there were several problems,
some of which were more difficult:

===== Distribution of scores =====
951..1000 51  ***************************************************
901.. 950  7  *******

A huge number of upperclassmen participated in this BRONZE competition:

  Distribution by grade:
    Grde  #  Percent
    2006  96 (31.0%) ***********************
    2007 107 (34.5%) **************************

52 regular competitors were promoted to SILVER. Those who were
promoted during the competition are not shown here.

## About the USACO Internet Programming Contests

These contests (the GOLD division in particular) are just incredibly
hard, really amazingly hard -- moreso nowadays than even just a a
couple years ago. Their difficult compares quite favorably with the
IOI competition.

Winners must master not only algorithmic techniques like dynamic
programming but also the ability to write bug-free code quickly.
This requires practice and skill.  Don't despair if you didn't get
a perfect score this time -- it is hard!

Furthermore, the scoring mechanism is set up so that a huge percentage
of finishers scores in the 0..500 range -- different from many
contests where everyone finishes in the 800..1000 range and the
0..800 range is empty.  If we don't do this, we can't distinguish
among the top competitors.

## Want to Learn More?

Check out the USACO training pages at http://ace.delos.com/usacogate .
They provide practice challenges that can help you move up in the
rankings.

## How USACO Scoring Works

The score results are shown below.  I used a program to determine
how much each problem was worth and how much each test case was
worth.  Basically, it counts how many people got test cases and
problems wrong and uses that to estimate a difficulty and choose a
weight.

Each problem has a certain number of test cases along with a "weight"
that tells how many of the 1,000 points come from that program.
The test cases are also weighted; here is an example:

            points weight 1  2  3  4  5  6
            ------------------------------
      probname: 39 396.6  6  5  6  5  6 11

If you score full marks on cases 1, 2, 3, and 4, you'd have 6+5+6+5=22
out of 39 points for this problem and you receive:

                22/39 * 396.6 = 223.7

total points out of 396.6 possible.  The sum of each problem's
points is your total score.

## Closing (Thanks and Solicitation)

Thanks to the USACO coaches who helped bring this contest together.
Special thinks to our translators.

USACO accepts -- and uses -- problem submissions from anyone!  You
have a real leg up in the contest if we use your problem.  Feel
free to send programming tasks to me.  We now have a staff of 20
coaches and assistant coaches who vet the problems and create
prototype solutions.  This enables us to have many contests throughout
the year with at least some level of predictable quality.
