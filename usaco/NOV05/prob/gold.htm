                           GOLD PROBLEMS
**********************************************************************
                  Three problems numbered 1 through 3
**********************************************************************

Problem 1: Asteroids [Gary Sivek, 2004]

Bessie wants to navigate her spaceship through a dangerous asteroid
field in the shape of an N x N grid (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 500).  The grid
contains K asteroids (1 &lt;= K &lt;= 10,000), which are conveniently
located at the lattice points of the grid.

Fortunately, Bessie has a powerful weapon that can vaporize all the
asteroids in any given row or column of the grid with a single shot.
This weapon is quite expensive, so she wishes to use it sparingly.
Given the location of all the asteroids in the field, find the
minimum number of shots Bessie needs to fire to eliminate all of
the asteroids.

PROBLEM NAME: asteroid

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two integers N and K, separated by a single space.

* Lines 2..K+1: Each line contains two space-separated integers R and
        C (1 &lt;= R, C &lt;= N) denoting the row and column coordinates of
        an asteroid, respectively.

SAMPLE INPUT (file asteroid.in):

3 4
1 1
1 3
2 2
3 2

INPUT DETAILS:

The following diagram represents the data, where "X" is an
asteroid and "." is empty space:
X.X
.X.
.X.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The integer representing the minimum number of times Bessie
        must shoot.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file asteroid.out):

2

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Bessie may fire across row 1 to destroy the asteroids at (1,1) and
(1,3), and then she may fire down column 2 to destroy the asteroids
at (2,2) and (3,2).

Problem 2: Grazing on the Run [Brian Dean, 2005]

A long, linear field has N (1 &lt;= N &lt;= 1,000) clumps of grass at
unique integer locations on what will be treated as a number line.
Think of the clumps as points on the number line.

Bessie starts at some specified integer location L on the number
line (1 &lt;= L &lt;= 1,000,000) and traverses the number line in the two
possible directions (sometimes reversing her direction) in order
to reach and eat all the clumps.  She moves at a constant speed
(one unit of distance in one unit of time), and eats a clump instantly
when she encounters it.

Clumps that aren't eaten for a while get stale.  We say the
``staleness'' of a clump is the amount of time that elapses from
when Bessie starts moving until she eats a clump.  Bessie wants to
minimize the total staleness of all the clumps she eats.

Find the minimum total staleness that Bessie can achieve while
eating all the clumps.

PROBLEM NAME: ontherun

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1 : Two space-separated integers: N and L.

* Lines 2..N+1: Each line contains a single integer giving the
        position P of a clump (1 &lt;= P &lt;= 1,000,000).

SAMPLE INPUT (file ontherun.in):

4 10
1
9
11
19

INPUT DETAILS:

Four clumps: at 1, 9, 11, and 19. Bessie starts at location 10.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: A single integer: the minimum total staleness Bessie can
        achieve while eating all the clumps.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file ontherun.out):

44

OUTPUT DETAILS:

Bessie can follow this route:

* start at position 10 at time 0
* move to position 9, arriving at time 1
* move to position 11, arriving at time 3
* move to position 19, arriving at time 11
* move to position 1, arriving at time 29

giving her a total staleness of 1+3+11+29 = 44.  There are other routes
with the same total staleness, but no route with a smaller one.

Problem 3: Walk the Talk [Hal Burch, 2005]

Farmer John has set up a puzzle for his cows to solve.  At the
entrance to the barn, he has laid out an H x W (1 &lt;= H &lt;= 30, 1 &lt;=
W &lt;= 30) grid of letters.  Before a cow can enter the barn, she
must spell out a valid English word by jumping from square to square,
creating a sequence of letters.  She can start at any square but
may only jump to a subsequent square that is located to the right
and/or above the current square (i.e., neither to the left nor
lower).  The next square can be any distance from the current one
since the cows are world-class jumpers!

No two cows may traverse the exact same path, although two cows are
allowed to spell the same word via different paths.

As an example, consider this grid (presuming 'TO' and 'OX' are
words):

  T X X O
  T X Q T
  X T X Q

Four paths are valid, all spelling 'TO' (one spelling requires a
'T' from the bottom row and an 'O' from the top row).  'OX' is a
valid word, but would require jumping to an 'X' square left of the
'O', which is not allowed.

Given the grid and a list of valid words, compute the number of
cows that can enter the barn without any cow repeating a path.  The
file `dict.txt' will be available and will contain the list of valid
words, one per line. See a copy of it at
http://ace.delos.com/usaco/dict-twalk.txt .

PROBLEM NAME: twalk

INPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: Two integers: H and W

* Lines 2..H+1: Each line contains W characters, without spaces,
        representing a row in the grid.  The first row is the top row.
         The first character in each row is the left-most character.

SAMPLE INPUT (file twalk.in):

3 4
TXXO
TXQT
XTXQ

OUTPUT FORMAT:

* Line 1: The number of cows that can enter the barn without repeating
        a path.

SAMPLE OUTPUT (file twalk.out):

4

OUTPUT DETAILS:

4 cows can enter the barn, each one spelling out one of the 'TO's.
